This is my Rock, Paper, Scissors game created using html/JavaScript as part of the  http://www.projectodin.com Front-End curriculum.

You can find the requirements for this project here

Initially it will run via the developers console using 'console.log'. Later I will build a page so it can be played in the main browser window.
